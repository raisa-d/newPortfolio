## Development Stage
7/28/2024: I have designed and coded:
- Navigational styling
- First pass at intro section
- Layout for projects section

7/30/2024:
- I got really excited about an idea to make the clouds start raining on hover. I ended up switching the clouds from images to straight CSS and used CSS to create a sort of storm of letters, numbers, and symbols. I thought that would be cool because it's sort of like it's raining code! - I also had an idea of displaying the projects in clamshells as the pearls inside, which I made a reality! I think they're really cute, but am still playing with the idea of making them coral or bubbles. A friend of mine gave me an idea of putting the tech stack in bubbles which is also a great way to incorporate them. 
- There is now an animation to scroll down from the nav elements to the parts of the page those sections are on.
- Restyled the "repo" and "live" buttons.
- Removed social media from the header and will have them only in the footer.

<ul>
  <li>Front-end: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript</li>
  <li>Design: Pen and paper because soemtimes I'm old school like that</li>
  <li>Version Control: Git</li>
</ul>

## Optimizations
The following design elements are my next priorities:
- Code about, services, and contact sections/pages
- Rework javascript to use OOP to make it more clear and readable
- Possibly restyle the projects section

## Lessons Learned
So far, I have learned that I need to set a timer and force myself to stop coding! I got very excited working on this design but I need to remember to take care of myself too.
